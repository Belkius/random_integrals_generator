# Random integrals generator
A random image generator used in training the Seq2Seq model for the handwritten integrals solver.
The program is generating images of definite integrals with some limitations, 
i.e. x is up to the power of 5 and not higher.
Every image is a representation of a random equation, created using images of handwritten symbols from this dataset: www.kaggle.com/xainano/handwrittenmathsymbols

The images were later used to train an Seq2Seq AI model to translate handwritten integrals.
